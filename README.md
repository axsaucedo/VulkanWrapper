This Vulkan Renderer features the following functionality:
* Texture loading
* Obj model loading
* Dynamic model loading
* Dynamic View Projection transformations
* Converting GLSL shaders to SPIRV
* Game loop
* Multiple Subpases
* Multiple descriptor sets 
* Dynamic buffers 
* Depth buffer based on vertex distance to camera
* Semaphores and fences to ensure parallel correctness
